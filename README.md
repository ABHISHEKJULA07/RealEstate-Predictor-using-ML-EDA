## 📌 Features

- Performed extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends, outliers, and key price drivers.
- Cleaned and processed **90,000+ property listings** using Pandas and NumPy.
- Applied models like **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest**, optimized with grid search.
- Used **feature engineering** and **correlation analysis** to boost model performance.
- Evaluated models using **R² Score**, **MSE**, and visual plots (residual, scatter, etc.).
